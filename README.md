This project is run solely by the creator, Jaren Kennedy also known as ImitationEcho.

## Description:
This is an indie game project made in Godot version 4.3
The game is currently in a design transistion so it is in a unrunnable state as systems are being rewritten.

This project is a 2d puzzle game with a focus steath and assasination as the problems to solve.

All art made for the project was made using Aseprite.

## Lessons learned
This project is my first experience with many game dev problems such as working with art directly, understanding the scope of what I am capable of, and many coding problems such as:

Working with multiple controllable characters at once - This feature is being removed from future version of the project as my scope for the project has changed. With the multiple controllable characters I learned fundamentals of Shape collsion systems and how to manage multiple forces acting on the same object at once.

I learned how to use Godot's various ways to animate sprites as I tried them to see which best fits the project.

I learned on how to create basic AI that react to stimulus from teh player such as sight and proximity meant to work as hearing.

And the lesson I take the most value in learning is the creation of the cords that connected the multiple controlable characters. The cords prevented the characters from moving too far from each other 

For future lessons that I am currently working on I seek to efficently code a playable character that has multiple control schemes based on the state the character is in, responding to player input and world stimuli.
